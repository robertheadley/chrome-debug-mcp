### Browser Control
```javascript
// Old (Puppeteer):
const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();

// New (Playwright):
const browser = await chromium.launch();
const context = await browser.newContext();
const page = await context.newPage();
```

### Resource Interception
```javascript
// Old (Puppeteer):
await page.setRequestInterception(true);
page.on('request', handler);

// New (Playwright):
await context.route(pattern, handler);
```
